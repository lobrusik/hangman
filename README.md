# Overall:
The project involves playing the popular game of “Hangman”. It was written based on the book "Flutter. Podstawy" by Krzysztof Baranowski.To play, you must first log in or create a new account. Then, the program retrieves words for the game from the Firebase database and draws a word for the player who tries to guess the word by letters. If he succeeds before the entire hangman is drawn, he can continue playing. If not - he starts from the beginning. I also plan to add scoring so that you can always return to the game.

# Features:
- Smooth, yet simple and aesthetic user interface on various platforms (Web, Android, iOS)
- Standard login via username and password (soon also in other ways)
- Words are fetched in real time from the Firebase database
- Simple game logic with difficult Polish words
- Clear messages in the form of pop-up windows

# Requirements
- Flutter: To install Flutter, follow the instructions on the official Flutter website.
- Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code with Flutter and Dart plugins installed.
- An Android/iOS emulator or a real device for testing.

# File description:
DATA SOURCE:
- words_local_source.dart
⋅⋅⋅This abstract class **`WordsLocalSource`** defines a contract for classes that provide access to local word sources. It declares a single method **`getWords()`** that must be implemented by subclasses. This method asynchronously retrieves a list of words and returns them wrapped in a Future.⋅⋅⋅
- words_memory_storage.dart
⋅⋅⋅The code defines a class **`WordsMemoryStorage`** that implements the **`WordsLocalSource`** interface. It retrieves words from Firestore, shuffles them, and returns them as a list asynchronously. In case of any errors during the retrieval process, it logs the error and returns an empty list.
        
DI:
    - di.dart
        This Dart code sets up a service locator (**`GetIt`** instance) for the Hangman app. It registers factories and lazy singletons for various classes used within the app for dependency injection.

ENUMS:
    - game_state.dart
        This Dart code defines an enumeration called **`GameState`** representing different states that the game can be in. Each state is described with a comment for clarity:
    
FEATURES:
    - APP:
        - splash_screen.dart
            This Dart code defines a **`SplashScreen`** widget, which displays a splash screen with a message and navigates to another screen after a delay of 3 seconds. It takes an optional **`child`** parameter, which represents the widget to navigate to after the splash screen. The splash screen displays a text message in the center of the screen. After the delay, it navigates to the specified child widget and removes all routes below it from the navigation stack
    - USER_OUT
        - firebase_auth_implementation
            - firebase_auth_services.dart
                This Dart code defines a service class called **`FirebaseAuthService`**, which provides methods for signing up and signing in users using Firebase Authentication. It utilizes the FirebaseAuth package.

            - It has a getter **`toGuess`** that returns a string representation of the word to guess. It maps each letter in the **`letters`** list to its **`valueToGuess`** property and converts it to a string.
            - It has a constructor **`WordToGuess`** that takes a list of **`Letter`** objects as a parameter.
            - It has a factory constructor **`empty()`** that creates an empty **`WordToGuess`** object with an empty list of letters.
            - The **`props`** getter is overridden to return a list containing the **`letters`** list. This is used by **`Equatable`** for equality comparisons.
        Overall, this class provides a representation of a word to be guessed in the Hangman game and ensures that instances of the **`WordToGuess`** class can be compared for equality efficiently using the **`Equatable`** package.
        
REPOSITORY
    - words_repository.dart
        This Dart file defines a class **`WordsRepository`**, which serves as a bridge between the application's data sources and the rest of the application. It interacts with the local data source (**`WordsLocalSource`**) to retrieve words for the Hangman game.

        1. **Imports**:
            - **`package:hangman/data_source/words_local_source.dart`**: Importing the **`WordsLocalSource`** class, which provides methods to access words from a local data source.
        2. **WordsRepository class**:
            - This class represents the repository responsible for handling word-related data operations.
            - It has a final field **`wordsLocalSource`**, which is an instance of **`WordsLocalSource`** injected into the repository.
            - The constructor initializes the **`wordsLocalSource`**.
            - It contains two asynchronous methods:
                - **`getWord(int index)`**: This method retrieves a word at a specified index from the local data source. It first retrieves all words using **`wordsLocalSource.getWords()`**, then checks if the index is within bounds. If so, it returns the word at the specified index; otherwise, it returns an empty string.
                - **`getWordsCount()`**: This method retrieves the total count of words available in the local data source. It fetches all words using **`wordsLocalSource.getWords()`** and returns the length of the list.
        These methods encapsulate the logic for retrieving words and their count from the local data source, providing a clean interface for other parts of the application to interact with word-related data.
